We Are Simply The Best Sociable/Community Organisation in the World……Ever

Round Table New Zealand is a National Association of tables (clubs) based throughout New Zealand. Membership is open to responsible community focused men between the ages of 18 – 45.

Each local table is autonomous and can work within the standard framework of the national constitution – so each table can adapt to what its members and local community needs.

We offer a community focused way to meet new people, develop personally and promote understanding and goodwill. We expect our members to participate fully in activities and are prepared to take responsibilities within the table. We encourage our members to be active, take an intelligent approach to being a good citizen, accept and display civic responsibility, and to promote high standards in both business and professional life. Round Table remains a neutral organisation in regards to the political and religious beliefs of its members
