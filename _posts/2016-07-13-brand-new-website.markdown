Welcome to the new Blenheim Round Table website. The goal of our site is to provide clear and concise information for prospective members and to give others in the community a way to see our great contributions.

The Round Table is an international organisation doing a lot of good not only in our community but around the world. We hope that by our actions we encourage and galvanize others to take part and take ownership of our community.

We organise many events, the Blues Brews and BBQ's probably being the most well known in Marlborough closely followed by the Marlborough Sports Awards.

We are always welcoming new members so if you have an interest in the community, organisation, or just want to be a part of a good group of blokes [email][email] us now and we will get in touch or alternatively simply turn up to our next meeting, the details of which are on the home page of this website.

Looking forward to meeting our new members

Webmaster
